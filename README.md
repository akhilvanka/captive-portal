# captive-portal

A simple frontend that uses our attendance-rs backend for RCSC.

## Attendance Architecture

The webpage is only a frontend for our new proposed sign in system. To learn more about the backend, view [attendance-rs](https://github.com/rcsc/attendance-rs) where this is a overview of the infrastructure. 

## Setup

Running the website is as simple as cloning the repo, making sure that all the packages are installed and creating a .env file. Then just run `node index.js` and the server will start.
